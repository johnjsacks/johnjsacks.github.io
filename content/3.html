<h1> Hot Day in May in Puget Sound </h1><br />
It is a hot day in the Puget Sound today. We're not used to temperatures this high this time of year! I'm sure everyone around here is struggling to find ways to stay cool. I'm sure the beaches will be packed with people trying to cool off in the water. I'm definitely going to be soaking up some sun and enjoying the warm weather while it lasts.</body>
